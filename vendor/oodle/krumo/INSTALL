                     SETUP: How to install Krumo ?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to use Krumo you have to put it on your (development) server, and 
include it in your script. You can put it somewhere in the INCLUDE_PATH, or 
specify the full path to the "class.krumo.php" file.

Next you'll need to rename krumo.sample.ini to krumo.ini, and make any 
setting changes. The krumo.ini is optional, Krumo will use "sane" defaults
if no krumo.ini is found, or the item is commented out.
